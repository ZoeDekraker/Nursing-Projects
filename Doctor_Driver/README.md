Help your GP’s to stay on track by knowing at a glance when the last GP progress note was completed for your residents. 

This tool can also be automated to audit as frequently as you like(i.e weekly, monthly etc) and can even be extended to have the report emailed to you as well. Speak to your I.T person(who should know PowerShell) to extend the functionality of this script for you. Bribery may be required.

How to use the Doctor Driver tool:

Export from your resident management software the progress notes that you wish to audit in a csv file format. 


2. This tool is built upon the structure of the sample progress notes shown here. It relies on the column header “Event”. Please adjust the script or your csv file to suit. Also first, last name and date headers.




3. To use the program simply click the ‘Select Progress Notes’ button to select the progress note file you wish to audit.




4. Click the ‘Select Resident List’ button to select the csv file with resident names you wish to check for. 

Column headers should be FirstName, LastName. Please adjust the script or csv file accordingly.

5. Click ‘Select Save Location’ to select where you would like the save the results to.


6. Simply click ‘Start Audit’ to start the audit. 


Now you don’t need to assume or spend hours auditing but instead know at a glance that residents are frequently seeing their GP. That is a nice peace of mind to have.
