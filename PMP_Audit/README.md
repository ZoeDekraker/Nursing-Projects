About this program: This program helps to speed up the auditing for PMP compliance by grouping therapy entries together by week and calculating the amount of entries per week. This is a fast way to identify any gaps in PMP charting at a glance. 

I.T people: XAML file in repo for GUI or add to script as a Here String (i.e $inputXAML = @”XAML code”@)



How to use the PMP Audit Buddy tool:

1.Export from your resident management software the resident’s PMP charting that you wish to audit in a csv file format. 

2. This tool is built upon the structure of the sample csv data shown here. It relies on the column header “Date” and that same date format. Please adjust the script or your csv file to suit.


3. To use the program simply click the ‘Select File’ button to select the csv file you wish to audit and then click ‘Start Audit’.


4. A screen will pop up to show you the results. The first column is the week number of the year(i.e there is 52 weeks a year, this is that week number).The next column is the total amount of entries counted for that week. If your 4b is 4xdays/week then you would want the Total Entries column to be 4. Anything less than 4 could indicate a gap in charting.


5. This result window also provides extra filtering and sorting functionality as shown here to filter results by entry numbers.








Auditing complete!

See, that was not as painful as it used to be was it?

(You will need to glance for the dates associated with the week of the year but this is an easy Google effort or simply count back weeks from the current week of year.)
