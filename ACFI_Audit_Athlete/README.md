Save your eyeballs and let the computer do the legwork for you.

Warning: Do not download or run programs without permission on work computers. Speak to your I.T person first. 

About the program: This auditing tool does a quick sweep of progress notes and only keeps those that may be relevant to the selected ACFI domain. 

I have intentionally created it to take a ‘wide sweep’ of progress notes - so you may occasionally find some progress notes in the results that are not helpful. That is okay, you have still saved yourself a few hours of auditing by using this tool. 

I have not created an executable file for download - please ask your I.T person to review the source code and create an exe for you. (Ticking boxes for both security and UX hopefully).

### ACFI Auditing Athlete






How to use the ACFI Auditing Athlete Tool:

1. Export from your Resident Management Software the progress notes you wish to review into a csv file. 

2. Save the progress notes as a csv file in a location you can find again.

3. In the ACFI Auditing Athlete - click on the first ‘select’ button and select the csv file of progress notes you created earlier. These are the notes that will be audited.


4. Click on the second ‘select’ button to choose where you would like the save the report from this audit and what you will name the file. The report will be saved to your computer.


5. Select which domain you would like to filter the results for.


6. Click ‘OK’ and the program will immediately run, opening up your newly created csv report in Excel - ready for you to review. How convenient is that!

That is it. Easy done.

You are now ready to audit up a storm, making sure that all levels of care being given are accurate and still have time for an afternoon nap.
