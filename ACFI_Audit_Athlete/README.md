# ACFI Audit Athlete

## What is it?
This auditing tool does a quick sweep of progress notes and only keeps those that may be relevant to the selected ACFI domain.
<br/>A second set of ACFI eyeballs to audit and catch any missed changes.

## Why?
Auditing progress notes for changes in resident care needs can be very time consuming with reading notes that are not relevant.
<br/> This tool filters the progress notes by the selected ACFI domain to identify changes in care needs earlier, audit more effeiciently and increase funding accordingly.
