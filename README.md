# What is this place?

This repo is a portfolio of projects and tools that I have developed. <br>
Including: Tools designed for use in the Healthcare setting, some I made to solve my own problems and fun projects.

## How to navigate this repo?

Each project has its own README file to describe what the project is, technology used and project notes.

A post and short description will be added to the project page on www.zoedekraker.com/projects which links to each project.

## Feedback is always welcome.
