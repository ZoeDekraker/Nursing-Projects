# What is this place?

This GitHub repo is a portfolio of projects and tools that I have developed mostly related to automating Aged Care Nursing tasks. <br/>
A mixture of Python, PowerShell and Power Automate Desktop flows. 
(These projects were prior to ChatGPT's release, which has changed the world and 10x'd our abilitiy to automate nursing tasks.)

## How to navigate this repo?

Each project has its own README file to describe what the project is, technology used and project notes/instructions.
<br/> Simply click on the folder name and scroll down to read the details.
