# Classy Claim Statements

## What is it?
A tool that converts a Medicare Claim Statement csv file into a 15 slide PowerPoint presentation including charts.

## Why?
Data visualisation helps to encourage data driven decisions for better operational performance and care. 
<br/>
Plus, who doesn't like some nice charts in a presentation done for you...? Just gotta style it to suit and impress people.

## Language:
Written in Python 3.10 
<br/>(not very OOP, quite procedural  & slightly messy. An early coding project that does work though)

2 external libraries used: 
  - Custom Tkinter (GUI) https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter 
  - Python PPTX (PowerPoint) https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx 


## How to use it:
